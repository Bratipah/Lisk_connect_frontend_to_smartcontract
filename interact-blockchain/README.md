# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract of NFT minting, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
create your project folder and cd into it
npx init --y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
npx hardhat compile - compile the contract
npx hardhat test - run test cases
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network lisk-sepolia - deploying contract
npx hardhat verify --network lisk-sepolia <deployed contract address> - verifying and publishing contract
npx hardhat help
```
